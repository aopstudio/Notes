# 黑盒测试
不深入代码细节的测试方法称为动态黑盒测试。软件测试员充当客户来使用它。又称闭着眼睛测试软件。主要针对软件界面和软件功能进行测试。

### The advantages of black-box testing:
The test is unbiased because the designer and the tester are independent of each other. 
The tester does not need knowledge of any specific programming languages. 
The test is done from the point of view of the user, not the designer. 
Test cases can be designed as soon as the specifications are complete. 

从理论上讲，黑盒测试只有采用穷举输入测试，把所有可能的输入都作为测试情况考虑，才能查出程序中所有的错误。实际上测试情况有无穷多个，人们不仅要测试所有合法的输入，而且还要对那些不合法但可能的输入进行测试。
完全测试是不可能的，所以我们要进行有针对性的测试，通过制定测试案例指导测试的实施，保证软件测试有组织、按步骤，以及有计划地进行。黑盒测试行为必须能够加以量化，才能真正保证软件质量，而测试用例就是将测试行为具体量化的方法之一。

## 正交表测试
Orthogonal array testing is a systematic, statistical way of testing. 

Orthogonal arrays could be applied in 
* user interface testing, 
* system testing,
* regression testing, 
* configuration testing ,
* performance testing.

Example ：
In order to improve a certain chemical products conversion rate，three factors which may affect the conversion rate are selected ，Reaction temperature（A），Reaction time（B）， alkali quantity （C），and the experiment range of them show below:
A：80°C～  90°C
B：90 min ～150 min
C：5% ～7%

Test goal：
Find out the conversion rate is affected by A, B, and C
Which is main condition? Which is secondary condition?
Determine the most appropriate production conditions

Experiment with several representative values of A , B and C.
A：A1= 80 ℃ ，A2= 85 ℃ ，A3= 90 ℃
B：B1=90min，B2=120min，B3=150min
C：C1=5%，C2=6%，C3=7%

**Level（水平）: Number of the values**

### Comprehensive test
Combination of all factors and levels
A1B1C1，A1B1C2，A1B1C3… …
33=27 times experiments are needed

Advantages 
* achieve good test results.

Disadvantages 
* If there are a lot of  factors and levels , then the experiment times is unacceptable. For example, factor amount is 6, and every level of them are 5，then experiment times is 56=15626

### Orthogonal test design 
Effective balanced the advantages of comprehensive test method and single factor test.
Select a typical, representative test points from a comprehensive points “level values of factors”. It can reflect the full circumstances.
Through a series of orthogonal design forms to achieve those tables called "orthogonal table."正交表

### Orthogonal table
is the key of orthogonal experiments design.
is form designed by a set of strict rules.
is defined by  $L_{Runs}(Levels^{Factors})$ ：
* Runs: 表的行数，即实验次数
* Factors: 表的列数，即因子个数
* Levels: 单个因子能取的值的最大个数
* c is column amount
* Experiment times=∑（level amount of every factor-1）+1

## 场景测试
Scenario testing is a software testing activity that uses scenario tests, or simply scenarios, which are based on a hypothetical story to help a person think through a complex problem or system for a testing environment. 

The ideal scenario has five key characteristics: 
* it is a story
* motivating
* credible
* complex
* easy to evaluate 

Important part of use case is the flow of events:
* 基本事件流
should cover what "normally" happens when the use case is performed.
* 替代事件流
covers behavior of an optional or exceptional character relative to normal behavior, and also variations of the normal behavior.

A three-step process for generating test cases from a fully-detailed use case
1. For each use case, generate a full set of use-case scenarios.
2. For each scenario, identify at least one test case and the conditions that will make it “execute”.
3. For each test case, identify the data values with which to test.

## 基路径测试
### Cyclomatic Complexity （基本复杂度/圈复杂度） 计算
Cyclomatic Complexity =
\#Edges - #Nodes + #terminal vertices (通常是2，如果入口和出口一样则是1) 
\#Predicate Nodes + 1 （判定节点数+1）
Number of regions of flow graph.

# 单元测试
Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually and independently scrutinized（审查） for proper operation. 
A Unit may be
* individual program, function, procedure, a method

Basic attributes of unit testing：
* Clear function
* Specifications definition 
* Clear Interface definition

Purpose of unit testing：
* Validate whether code is consistent with the design.
* Trace the implementation of requirements and design.
* Discovery the errors among design and requirement.
* Discovery the errors introduced during coding process.

Benefits
* The goal of unit testing is to isolate each part of the program and show that the individual parts are correct. 
* A unit test provides a strict, written contract that the piece of code must satisfy. 
* Unit tests find problems early in the development cycle.

种类
* Static testing
    * It is primarily syntax checking of the code and/or manually reviewing the code or document to find errors. 
    * This type of testing can be used by the developer who wrote the code, in isolation. 
    * Code reviews, inspections and walkthroughs are also used. 
* Dynamic testing

**Misunderstanding about unit testing** 
Unit testing wastes so much time .
Unit testing only prove what has been done by codes.
Because I’m a great programmer , I do not need conduct unit testing.
In any case，integration testing will seize all bugs. 
Low cost efficiency.

Stub：is used to simulate the calling modules in tested module working process. Generally  they only process few data.
Driver module：is used to simulate superior module of tested module. It receives testing data, transmits related to tested module, starts tested module and prints corresponding results.

**Top-down unit testing strategy**
Test the top level firstly, take the unit called by top level as stub，and then test the second level, take the unit that has been tested as driver module sequentially .
**Bottom-up unit testing strategy**
Test the bottom module firstly, set up driver module for it, and then test the upper module, take the module has been tested as stub sequentially.
**Isolation testing**
Not consider the relationship between modules, design sub and driver module for every module.
